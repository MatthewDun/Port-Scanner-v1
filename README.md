# Port-Scanner-v1
This is a port scanner created by Matthew Dunnavant. 

A port scanner is an application that probes a server/host for open ports.
It starts with sending a client requests to a range of server port 
addresses to a target, with the goal of finding an active port.

HOW TO USE:

For linux OS, compile in the directory wherever this repo is added to with the command "g++ Port_scanner", then to run the script input "./a.out"
